**How to start with this**

Create a date based commit like this :+1:

```git commit --date='10-13-2016' -m 'message that you want to type'```
In this commmit with shift to date 13 Oct. 2016. 

To shift this commit on this date, not todays date then take it sha flag first
 ```git rev-parse HEAD```
 
 And using the hash from above shift that hash to a date, like to 13 Oct.2016
